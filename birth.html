  <p>Music booming and chatter filled the atmosphere in household.<br>
     The yard was occupied by the little kids playing tag and popping<br>
     balloons. Under the apple tree sat the birthday girl and her favorite <br>
    cousins giggling and playing with the latest Bratz dolls.Wiping her<br>
    hands on her dress, Lexi finally placed her doll next to the<br>
     other dolls in the small trench she dug up.<br><br>

  <p>“Okay girls, we can have a pool party now,” her cousin spoke in a <br>
    high pitched voice as she finished puttingon the swimsuit on her doll.<br>
</p>

    <p>“Lexi, it’s time to open the presents!” Mother came over<br>
      and lifted Lexi up. She gasped and furiously<br>
    wiped off the now smudged mud stains on her sparkly dress.<br>
    “What did I say about playing in the mud, Lexi?”</p>

    <p>Ripping open her third gift now, she smiled slightly as she pulled<br>
    out a battery operated baby doll, her first and second being a <br>
    doctor set and a giant dollhouse. The cameras kept clicking as she <br>
    pulled out another box. It was a nintendo. Before saying anything,<br>
    Mother interrupted by bringing out the cake.</p>


Not knowing what to play with, she narrowed it down to her doctor set and nintendo.<br>

<p> <strong> A Different Day</strong><br>

Playing in her room alone, she gathers her dolls in a circle.<br>
“How are we going to get to the ball?”, the blonde doll ‘spoke’.<br><br>

“The fairy godmother granted us the power to fly!”<br>
 Mom is watching and suggests that they should take a<br>
 magical unicorn or pumpkin to the ball or perhaps have a prince<br>
 take them. Later the older brother, Mark, comes in and sees the<br>
 girl has one of his toys. She plays with it and won't give it back.<br>
  Mark pushes her and yanks the toy out of her hands, ruthlessly. </p>
