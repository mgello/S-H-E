    <p>The teacher finishes up reading the short story to the<br>
      kids and looks up to see them all bouncing with anticipation.<br>
      The scholastic book fair was today and they were all excited<br>
      to spend on toys, books, more toys, and all sorts of things to<br>
      distract them from their learning time in class.<br>
      “Okay kids, please line up and we’ll go in groups of 5 at a time, okay?”<br>

      The children scurried to try to get to the front and<br>
      Lexi was not too far behind. When it was finally<br>
      her time to go, she made sure to take her time; she wanted<br>
      to get a good look at everything. </p>

  </div>


<div id=toysfirst style="display:none">
<p>  Sensing the toys were probably going to run out first, Lexi hurries to <br>
  the toys and looks at what they have.<br>
  Erasers? Nope. Bookmarks? Nope. She looks for a while until she sees a <br>
  pen that has a bird with big eyes on the top of it.<br><br>

  Lexi laughs when she sees the bird’s eyes pop when it’s<br>
  squeezed. Knowing she only has enough money to buy one thing, she<br>
  contemplates whether she should stick with this or buy a book.</p>

                      and buy the toy instead. She was so excited to show everyone what<br>
                      she had just bought and was the first thing she talked about when<br>
                      she got home from school.<br>

                        “Mommy mommy! Look what I got! Its eyes pop out like a bug it's so funny,”<br>
                        Lexi yells in joy, continuously squishing the top of the pen.<br>
                        The mom looks at her daughter and sighs a little bit. “Why didn’t you get<br>
                        a book instead Lexi?” She pauses for a moment not fully<br>
                        understanding why she seemed upset.<br>

                        “Well…”<br>

                        “I want you to read more Lexi, a pen won't help you grow and be smart.”</p>

  <p>The chatter filled cafeteria took up Lexi’s thoughts, as<br>
  she waited for her best friend to get their lunch. Gossip soared almost<br>
  violently amongst the rest of the middle schoolers. Josephine, her best friend,<br>
  appeared with a sandwich in her hand and an eager smile on her face.<br>

  “what’s with the scary grin Jo??” Lexi teases.<br>

  Josephine playfully pushes her and retorts at the comment.<br>
  “i am<em> not</em> scary! I just have some news”<br>

  “what is it this time?”<br>

  “.. I saw Jacob flirting with you earlier! What is going on with that huh?”<br>

  Confusion sprung in her mind. “What? No, he was pushing me earlier for some reason”<br>

  Giving me a face she responds with, “he pushes you because he likes you, duh!”</p>

    “Right? Like Mr. Nicolson gives us a lot of work but at<br>

    Brenda, who has been staying quiet throughout, finally spoke up.<br>
    “I think both of you guys need to reevaluate. You're so quick to<br>
    criticize her and compare her.”<br><br>

    Christian just scoffs, mutterrung a “whatever.”<br>

    After a while of hanging out they decide to part ways and head to<br>
    their dorm rooms. The sun has begun to set and Lexi knows<br>
    there is on campus security, but she can’t help but feel a degree<br>
    of fear walking alone this late.<br><br>


    Fortunately, Lexi gets inside the building safely and<br>
    catches an open elevator with another person inside. As the<br>
    elevator arrives on her floor and the doors open, the individual<br>
    inside squeezes her waist.</p>

  The sound of the Keurig spitting out the last bit of coffee into Lexi’s<br>
  cup wakes her up a little bit.  It’s been a while now since she started<br>
  working as a consultant but she still hasn't gotten used to the amount<br>
  of work given. On top of that, she just came back from her first international<br>
  business trip in Finland and jetlag has not let her rest.<br><br>

  Joshua, a co-worker of hers, nears her and sees the tired, wary look<br>
  on her face.<br>
  “Look alive Lexi! You look so much prettier when you smile,” he exclaims,<br>
  smiling while nudging her shoulder as he sets his cup under the coffee maker.</p>

   <div id=thankyou style="display:none">
     <p>“Thank you..?” Lexi says with her head tilting to the side a bit.<br>
     Tipping his coffee mug a little bit in the air as a gesture,<br>
     Joshua responds, “You're welcome!”<br>


     --------<br>

      Lexi walks to the lunch table where other coworkers of hers are<br>
      sitting and chatting. As she approaches, it seems as if they are talking<br>
      about Mary’s newborn.<br><br>

      “I’m glad she is getting the rest. Do you think she's going to continue working?<br>
      You know.... now that her baby is born,” one woman says to the others.<br><br>

      “I would think so? She would be so bored at home all day.”<br><br>

      “But how can she let someone else raise her child for her?<br>
      That is not good for the baby.”<br><br>

      After this last comment, the rest of the group just sigh or hum in agreeance.<br>
      Almost a minute of silence and chewing pass by when another member of the<br>
      table directs a question towards Lexi.<br><br>

      “How about you Lexi? Do you have a child? Or a husband?”</p>

                    “You sure have him well trained!”<br><br>

    The sound of your baby crying floods your ears.<br><br>

    You look at your partner with nothing but joy in your eyes.<br>
    You both had no idea this would be happening, yet here you both are.<br>
    The baby calms down as you rock her back and forth gently.<br>

    Your partner looks to you and asks, “what should we name her?”</p>

<div id=end style="display:none">
  <p>This moment is filled with happiness, yet your smile falters just<br>
  a little bit at the thought her growing up and learning<br>
  about the harsh world as a woman alone. It seems so early to think<br>
  of such a time but you can't seem help it.<br><br>

  “I promise I will try my best to give you the best life I can [baby name].<br>
  Whatever you become, whatever you choose to do, I want you<br>
  to know that I believe in you.”<br><br>

  The baby begins to quiet down with the soft sound of your voice.<br><br>

  “Even if it seems like the world and everyone else are against you,<br>
  I want you to try and not let it bother you. You are valuable in every aspect.<br>
  Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.”<br><br>

  You will not be undermined for being a girl.</p>
