  Ending up in her room, she started to contemplate whether<br>
  being able to play with the same toys as her<br>
  brother was the right thing to do, and whether she was a bad<br>
  daughter for even wanting to play with his toys.<br>
   Her mother later came in and hugged her.<br>
  Her mother spoke softly to her,<br><br>

  “I know you understand, those are your brother’s toys,<br>
  we bought you separate toys specifically for you, ones<br>
   that we knew you would like.”<br>

        Lexi is brushing her teeth rapidly trying to think of<br>
        what she should wear for her first day of second grade.<br>
        She rinses her mouth and toothbrush and places it back into<br>
        the cup. She goes to her closet and grabs her favorite sneakers<br>
       blue pants, black t-shirt, and her favorite black cap that<br>
       one of her cousins gave her. She grabs her backpack and scarfs<br>
        down her cereal as her mom began to grab her bag and shoes.<br>
        Lexi puts her bowl in the dishwasher and follows her mom to the car.<br>
         She is now sitting down in class waiting for her bestfriend, Josephine.<br>
          A boy walks in and yells across the room <br><br>

          “Lexi, why are you dressed like a boy? You're a girl and girls can’t wear that.” </p>

      Lexi is going back-to-school shopping with her best friend. They are<br>
       excited to walk into the first day of high school with their new outfits<br>
        and show everyone their cool new shirts with their favorite band on<br>
        the front. The first day of school rolls around and Lexi puts on the<br>
        shirt that she’s been so excited to wear. She walks into her first<br>
         period class. Ms. Davis immediately notices Lexi’s shirt.<br>
         In front of the entire class she calls her name and says,<br><br>

         “I know this is your first year in high school but this is NOT acceptable.” <br>
         She walks towards Lexi and tells her to change immediately because<br>
         the shirt she is wearing is too revealing and is showing off her<br>
         shoulders. She proceeds to tell her that she needs to go to the<br>
         office to get a sweater to cover up so that she won't distract the<br>
         boys in her room.</p>

  You tell the principal this, but he response is not what you<br>
  were hoping for.<br><br>

  “I know that you like the shirt but it is not school appropriate,<br>
  we don't allow spaghetti straps because the girls will distract the guys.”<br><br>

    <p> <strong>August 15, 2020 <br> Age:18 <br></strong>
        Ever since you were younger your favorite subjects have been<br>
        math and science. This led you to know you wanted to go into<br>
        a STEM field career. Going into college, one of the classes<br>
        you were the most excited about was physics. After a few<br>
        classes you can tell this is going to be a great semester.<br>
        One day you decide to go eat out with your friend Karen and her<br>
        friend Jake. Karen introduces you and Jake and you guys get to<br>
        talking about college. Karen excuses herself to the bathroom.<br>
        You tell him what you're studying and he raises an eyebrow.<br>
        He follows this gesture with a comment. <br><br>

        “Did you just take the class because you want to meet more guys.”<br><br>

        You chuckle as if it didn't bother you and ask him what he means.<br>
        He tells you,<br>
        “You know what I mean. Girls don't go into physics because its<br>
        usually too hard, so are you just taking the class to meet a<br>
        guy or something? You know, because so many guys take the class”.<br>
        You look at him in awe. You can't believe what just came out of his mouth.<br>
        Karen walks back and sits down. </p>

    <div id=button8>
      <button class="button" onclick="disrespectful();removeButtons8()">Let him know he is incorrect and disrespectful</button>
      <button class="button" onclick="tellkaren();removeButtons8()">Leave and tell Karen about it later</button>

</div>

<div id=disrespectful style="display:none">
  You stand up and ask him if he's serious. You let him know<br>
  that you're actually one of the best students in your class<br>
  and doing really well. You tell him how wrong he is and<br>
  how his comment is super disrespectful. Just when you think<br>
  he's about to apologize he tells you,<br><br>

  “This is what I mean, you guys are too emotional and can't handle hard courses like physics.”<br>
  It feels like you shouldn't be surprised at this comment because<br>
  of the entire situation but you still are. You walk away because<br>
  at this point you realize nothing in Jake's head will change his views.<br>

  Your anger slowly but surely builds up until you can't<br>
  take it anymore. You decide its best to leave. Karen and<br>
  Jake say bye to you but you only respond to Karen. Later<br>
  that day you tell Karen the whole situation and she is angry<br>
  about this as well. She said that he would say small remarks<br>
   similar to that, but she always just brushed it off as<br>
   a joke. Right as you were leaving, Jake told<br>
   Karen that you were rude for not saying bye and that<br>
   you were probably just on your period or something.<br>

    <p> <strong> November 20, 2030 <br> Age:28<br> </strong>
      You are now much older with an amazing partner. Time has passed<br>
      and you decided looking for a job would be best right away.<br>
      So you decide to ask around and look online. You come across<br>
      this one specific job that catches your eye. You decide it will<br>
      be the best option and job for the moment. You turn in your resume<br>
      and they ask you for an interview. The day of the interview<br>
      finally comes and you feel ready and confident. They call your<br>
      name and it's your time to go. After several questions it seems<br>
      to be going really well, you feel as if you have this job in the<br>
       bag and that you will enjoy it here. The man interviewing you asks you,<br><br>

       “So, do you have any children, and if so, who is going to watch the kids while at work?”<br>

<div id=button11>
  <button class="button" onclick="dontrespond(); removeButtons11();">refuse to respond to that question</button>
  <button class="button" onclick="answer(); removeButtons11();">Answer respectfully</button>
</div>
</div>

<div id=dontrespond style="display:none">
  You dont tell him anything. Knowing that he wouldn't<br>
  ask a man the same question, you wait for his response.<br>
  He simply says that if you do work here you would have to have someone<br>
  to help you look after your kids. He says missing<br>
  a lot of work for your kids is unacceptable. You walk away knowing<br>
  that with this reponse, your chance is now slim, but if it is still offered<br>
  you will still probably have to take it, because you really need it.<br>

  You decide you need the job and that it will just be best<br>
  to answer the question and not say anything else. It's shocking<br>
   to you that he can ask such questions that you know for a fact<br>
 he wouldn't ask a man. You tell him that you don’t have kids<br>
   and that time shouldn't be an issue.<br>

  <p>“Hey aunt lexi why didn't you guys have kids so I could play with them?”<br><br>

“Well Jenny we decided we weren't ready for a kid and we might not be ready for a kid ever.”<br><br>

"I thought when you get married, you're supposed to have a kid?"<br><br>

"Not necessarily, where did you hear that?"<br><br>

"I dont know"<br><br>

"Jenny, no matter what anybody says you dont have to follow what they say you should do,<br>
or follow whatever anybody expects you to be.<br>
You're an amazing, smart, and independent person. Be true to yourself."<br><br>

Lexi knew she would not have any kids of her own, she along with her partner just<br>
felt like they shouldn't, and so they didn't. But she knew that in a world like this,<br>
she had young girls such as Jenny, her niece, who looked up to her so much, and with<br>
everything she had experienced in her lifetime, she wanted to make sure that jenny knew<br>
she was a strong, intelligent, and capable person no matter what.<br>
