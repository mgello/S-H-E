  <p>Lexi calls her mother and tells her mother about her brother's<br>
   aggressive behavior.<br><br>
   The mother turns to her brother and tells him, “Let Lexi have the toy.<br>
   She’s a girl and your sister.<br>
   You don’t fight with girls.” “But that’s my toy,” says Mason.” “I don’t care,”<br>
   said their mother and walked off toward the kitchen.<br>
   Mason runs off and tells their father about what happened.<br><br>

Mason returns but not alone,“Lexi give Mason back his toy,” said their father.<br>
“But Mom said I could play with the toy,” said Lexi.<br>
“That’s a boy toy, you’re only supposed to play with girl toys,” replied their<br>
father, frustrated. “But I promise, I’ll give the toy back after I’m done playing with it,”<br>
said Lexi crying. “Just because you started crying doesn’t mean you’re going<br>
to get your way”. Lexi throws the toy down and runs<br>
upstairs, “Girls,” said their father shaking his head.<br>

    Lexi and her friend are at their neighborhood park, playing on the swings,<br>
    when Tommy, a boy from their school, came over and started bothering them.<br>
    “Tommy leave us alone”, said Lexi. “Nope,” Tommy replied, pushing her.<br>
    “Stop Tommy before I fa-,” before Lexi could finish her sentence<br>
    she falls off the swing. “Ouch, my arm.".<br>
    “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to,” said Tommy, “Yes you did I told you to stop,” complained<br>
    Lexi.

 Lexi walks into her house and yells “Mom!”, “In the kitchen sweetheart,” said her mother.<br>
  “Oh... What happened to you?”, her mother exclaimed, shocked.<br>
 “Tommy pushed me off the swing set”, said Lexi.<br>
 “Aww, Sweetie, you’ll be fine.<br>
  It’s just a little scratch”. “He’s a bully!”<br>

  “Oh no sweetie that just mean he likes you”, explained<br>
  her mother.<br><br>

“How is that so?" “If a boy picks on you that just means he has a crush on you”,<br>
 said her mother. Her mother looks at Lexi who still looks curioused and said<br>
 “You know what just forget about what I just said.<br>
  Go find something to do until dinner is ready within the next hour”.<br>
  Lexi walks off and goes to her room. While in her room, she tries<br>
  to find something to do until dinner is ready. “What should I do?”,<br>
  Lexi thinks to herself, looking around room. After what seems like hours<br>
  figuring out what to do, she came up with two choices.<br>

   “What does mean to hit like a

   “Yeah, you’re right," Lexi agrees.<br>
    both of them run toward the sandbox.<br>

 A week later<br><br>

Lexi and Mason were in living room watching cartoons when their father came into<br>
the living room and announced, “Mason go take the trash out and Lexi go wash the dishes.”<br>
Mason gets on and turns off the TV. “Why can’t I take the trash out? Why does Mason<br>
always get the easier chores?”, asks Lexi, perplexed.<br>

Lexi just started highschool and she’s super excited. “Lexi and Mason- breakfast is ready!”,<br>
their mother yells from downstairs. “Okay Lexi you don’t have<br>
to be nervous about highschool. It’s not bad. Right?”, Lexi asked herself.<br>
Looking into the mirror  at herself. “Why are you in here talking to yourself?",<br>
asks Mason. “Do you not know how to knock?” “Nope! Anyway,<br>
Mom said to come get breakfast.” “I’ll be down there in a minute."<br>

Lexi walks into her closet, trying to figure out which outfit<br>

Lexi is currently walking around the extracurriculars fair. She’s debating on<br>
which club or sport to join. She’s stuck between joining the video game club or the soccer team.<br><br>

Lexi walks over to the video game club booth. “Excuse me,” Lexi tried to start the conversation. “The booth for the<br>
cheerleading is to the right,” replied the boy running the booth. <br><br>“I’m not interested in joining
the cheerleading team, I want to join the videogame club,” replied Lexi, frustrated.<br><br>
“Are you sure?” asked the boy, looking uncertain. “Yes. You think just because<br>
I’m a girl I don’t know how to play video games?” Lexi is angry.<br><br>
“Wow I just asked you a question.." "Joey you know females<br>
 are mad sensitive,” said a different boy, making people around them start laughing.<br>
 “You guys are so immature. Nevermind, I don’t want to join your club anymore.” <br>
 Lexi walks away.</p>

“Lexi when are you getting married?” “Lexi when are going to started having kids?”<br>
“Have you thought that it might be time to start settling down?” “You know your clock is running down<br>
to have kids. Right?”<br><br>

“That’s all I have been hearing for the past 4 years! Not once has anyone told me<br>
congratulations on my promotion to vice president, or my new house or<br>
on publishing my own book!”<br>
Lexi thinks to herself, "I can’t even have a conversation with my mother without her talking about how<br>
proud she is of my brother, Mason, on getting married and having kids and that<br>
I should start being more like Mason. I vow to myself that when I have a kid,<br>
I will teach them that you don’t have to follow society's “rules” and that you<br>
don’t have to do what you are expected to do or behave a certain way based on your gender. To follow your<br>
heart no matter what."</p>
