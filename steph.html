    <strong>September 10th, 2013 <br> age 11</strong>
  <p>Due to their family’s move, Lexi and her brother missed the first week of school. Mark was thrilled. He would sing “one more week of FREEDOM” everywhere he went- at the grocery store, in the shower, in the car, around the house. For Lexi, on the other hand, this was not a celebratory moment. She was nervous about how she would fit in at her new school. Not only was she worried about being the “new kid” in 4th grade, but she was also worried about finding a group of friends since the “cliques” would already been formed.
---
Outside during recess, Lexi sees a group of girls sitting on a bench, talking. She wants to approach them, but she is afraid of being perceived negatively. On the other side of the school’s playground, she sees a soccer game at play.  </p>

<div id=girlclique style="display:none">
Lexi approaches the girls on the bench with a big smile, but she quickly notices that the girls are watching her every move. The group of girls stand up and move to another bench.

                    Despite noticing that only boys are playing in the soccer game, Lexi politely asks to join the game. At first no one seems to notice her until eventually the goalie of one of the teams shouts, “What do you want?! You are blocking my view of the field! MOVE!” Lexi asks to join the game once again and the same goalie responds, “The only position we are willing to give you is the position of a cheerleader.”

                    Lexi sits alone on a bench directly across from the school’s main entrance. She feels hopeless, for so far her first day at her new school has not been off to a good start. Meanwhile, she catches a glimpse of her brother who just joined in on the soccer game and is already laughing with the other boys. There are 15 minutes before the bell rings for school to start. Out of nowhere, a smiling girl appears asking, “Hello! What is your name?” “My name is Lexi.” “Nice to meet you, Lexi! My name is Josephine. Would you like to come join me with the other girls?”

                                    Josephine turns to Lexi with a look of relief. “Good! I was just joking. I wouldn’t want to be in that group either. From now on, we shall be partners in crime. Yin and Yang. The unstoppables.” Lexi looks at Josephine in amazement, wondering how she can be so different, so much more pure than the rest of the people in this school seem to be.

                                    <p> “Lexi! Josephine! Mark! Come on, you guys! You’ll be late for school!”, shouts Dad from downstairs. Lexi and Josephine come rushing down the stairs. It’s their first day of high school and Josephine had slept over so that she and Lexi could go conquer their first day together. “Wow, I can’t believe it’s been five years since your goofy face came to interrupt my peace and quiet.” Josephine looks at Lexi, slightly offended, “Hey! If it weren’t for me, you probably would’ve been a loser sitting alone until the end of the school year.” Lexi playfully punches Josephine on the shoulder and the two girls start giggling and nostalgically sharing memories from their elementary school days. Mr.W drops them off at school and the two friends begin walking towards the main entrance. On their way there, a boy crosses their path. “Hello, ladies! My name is Peter. You look like freshmen. Are you freshman? I’m a freshman, too. I am sooo excited for high school!” Little did the two girls know, that the overly talkative boy standing in front of them and waving his hands around as he speaks would become their third musketeer…
-----
“PETERRRRR, come on!!!”, Josephine insists. “We have got to leave now before Lexi and her family arrive at the bowling alley!” “Alright, alright, let’s go.” The two get into Josephine’s car and Peter asks, “Remind me again why we can’t tell her?” “Because she’d feel betrayed!” Peter pulls out of the parking space and- Murphy's Law of course- that’s the exact same moment as Lexi and her family are waiting to find an open parking space.

 Mr. W sees a car pulling out and rushes towards the parking space.

“Hey, isn’t that-,” he tries to say.

“Yes, it’s Peter and Josephine,” replies Lexi.

“Didn’t they tell you they aren’t free tod-,”

“Yes, they did.”

Meanwhile, in Peter’s car:

“Shoot, shoot, shoot, shooooot. Do you think she saw us???”

“Peter, your car is recognizable from 5 miles away. Of course she saw us!”

“What do we do now??”

“I don’t know!!!”

Lexi cannot believe that Peter and Josephine have lied to her. Why? Do they no longer want to be her friend? Are they dating? Why is it a secret?

<div id=calljosephine style="display:none">
Josephine answers the phone and there is a minute of silence on the line. Josephine finally breaks the silence, “Lexi, look, we’re sorry.”
“You’re sorry? Did you not think about how this could hurt my feelings? Why weren’t you simply direct with me? I mean, c'mon Jo, we’ve been friends forever...”

Peter takes the phone from Josephine, “Jesus, Lexi , why do you have to be so dramatic?”

--------

The next day at school, Lexi sits alone at lunch. Peter and Josephine look at her from a distance, sitting at their usual seats at lunch. Lexi sees Peter shaking his head ‘no’ as Josephine says something to him. Josephine looks over at Lexi and the two make short eye contact. From behind her, Lexi hears someone whisper, “Do you think they dated within their group of 3? Josephine and Lexi, Peter and Lexi, Josephine and Peter now, and next probably all three of them at once.” Lexi takes her plate of food and moves to eat alone, in peace, sitting on the floor of a bathroom stall. }

<div id=college style="display:none">
    <strong> 2022<br> age 20</strong>
  <p>Lexi was an excellent student not only in high school, but also in college. She excelled in her studies and received straight A’s which her persevering attitude and endless hours of hard work deserved. Unfortunately, the students at her college did not see it that way. “She must be sleeping with the professors,” they would say. “There is no way she can fairly get an A in his class.” These rumors traveled quickly throughout campus until one day Lexi heard it come up in her roommate’s discussion with a friend. Lexi was about to enter her dorm room, but took her hand off the handle when she heard her name.

“Wow, how shallow Lexi is.”

“Doesn’t she have at least a little self respect?”

“How could she show her face at home? Her parents are probably very proud of her but little do they know. Or maybe they also find it suspicious and are embarrassed to call her their daughter.”

“They probably lie that she has a 3.8 GPA instead of boasting about her 4.0 GPA just to preserve their family’s dignity.”

Both voices begin to giggle from inside the dorm room. Lexi is in shock. This is the first time she has heard someone talk about her this way and not just anyone, but her roommate, Sarah, with a friend. Lexi had noticed that she had been getting awful stares from other students, but she had no idea it was for such a horrific lie.

Some professors are just impossible, so you defying the odd is highly suspicious,” replies Sarah.
  ---------
  At the library, Lexi takes out her chemistry textbook to finish the set of problems she had determined to complete for today. The library is almost entirely empty. Lexi tries to concentrate, but she cannot stop thinking about the conversation she had just overheard. “How can people be so cruel?”, she thought to herself. Tears begin to stream down her face. A guy comes up to her and whispers in her ear, “You’re sexy even when you smear your mascara. No wonder you are cruising through your classes.” The guy leaves Lexi feeling more worthless than ever.

  Lexi and her mother continue a casual conversation as Sarah and her friend sneak out of the room. Lexi is relieved that they are gone. She doesn’t mention anything about the rumor to her mother.

  <p>At her job interview, Lexi is asked a series of questions by her interviewer, John. Towards the end, her tells her that he cannot give her the leadership position she had applied for, for her believes a woman is not assertive enough to be able to hand all of the administrative work required for the position, but what he can do is offer a different good position that does not require managing a team.

  At the bus station, she calls her father to tell him about the interview. While she is talking on the phone, a man also waiting for the bus overhears her conversation. As soon as Lexi closes the phone call, the man approaches her.

  “Excuse me, miss. I’m sorry for overhearing your conversation, but I’m actually looking to fill a managing position for the field you’re interested in. Would you like an interview? My name is Russell and it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
